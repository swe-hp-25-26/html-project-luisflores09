        <p>I am a person who is pasionate about my family, music and technology. I was born in Chihuahua, 
            Mexico and moved to Houston in 2007. I always had a pasion
            for computers ever since my Godfather gave me my first computer as a gift when I was 8 years old.
            I would play videogames and download music mostly, it was since then that I started learning
            how to use a computer. 
        </p>
        <p>I remember downloading music and burning CDs for my family and friends.
            Back in highschool is when I first started learning about programming and web development, I took a 
            web design and a computer science class where I started learning the basics of computers.
